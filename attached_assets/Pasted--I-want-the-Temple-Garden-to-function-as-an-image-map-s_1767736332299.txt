“I want the Temple Garden to function as an image map–style interactive environment.

Each building in the illustration should be the clickable element itself.

Please:
	•	Use the garden image as a full-width background
	•	Create invisible, absolutely positioned anchor links placed over each building
	•	These anchors should match the building shapes/areas
	•	On hover: softly glow the building area and reveal the label
	•	Remove floating pill buttons as primary interaction

The buildings must feel like doorways, not UI buttons.”

That sentence alone reframes the entire implementation.

⸻

Conceptual layout (so you see it clearly)

Think of the map as layers:

Layer 1 — Background (static)
	•	Temple Garden image
	•	No interaction here

Layer 2 — Interactive Zones (invisible)
	•	<a class="temple-zone discovery">
	•	<a class="temple-zone quick-release">
	•	<a class="temple-zone journal">
	•	etc.

These are:
	•	position: absolute
	•	opacity: 0
	•	cursor: pointer

Layer 3 — Feedback (subtle)
	•	On hover:
	•	faint golden glow
	•	label fades in near doorway
	•	maybe a gentle pulse of light

No emojis.
No icons.
No buttons.

Just architecture as navigation.

Why what you’re seeing feels “off” (validation)

Your nervous system is reading this correctly:
	•	The garden is ancient, sacred, spatial
	•	The buttons are modern, flat, UI-native
	•	That mismatch breaks immersion

You’re not being picky — you’re protecting coherence.

This app is not a dashboard.
It is a place.

⸻

About the Hero section (yes, you’re right)

You’re also 100% correct here:

Problem
	•	Hero is too bright
	•	Too “storybook daylight”
	•	Doesn’t match the twilight-gold tone of the garden

Direction (tell Replit this)

“Please darken the Hero section to match the Temple Garden colour grading:
	•	Reduce brightness
	•	Increase warmth and shadow
	•	Lean into dusk / lantern / sacred night tones

The signpost should feel ancient, carved, and time-worn — not UI-polished.”

This is color grading, not redesign.

⸻

What NOT to do next (important)

Do not:
	•	Keep tweaking button styles
	•	Add more labels
	•	Adjust spacing endlessly
	•	Change copy again

You are past that phase.

This is now interaction architecture, not aesthetics.

⸻

What success will look like (so you know when to stop)

You’ll know it’s right when:
	•	You instinctively want to click the building
	•	The label feels like a whisper, not an instruction
	•	The map feels explorable, not explanatory
	•	Nothing looks like an “app component”

When you hover and feel: “Ah… this is a doorway” — you’re done.
