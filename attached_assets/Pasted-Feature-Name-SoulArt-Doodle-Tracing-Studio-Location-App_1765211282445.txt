Feature Name: SoulArt Doodle Tracing Studio
Location: App navigation → Art Meditation
Purpose:
Provide a calm, meditative drawing space where users can:
	•	Choose from SoulArt-style templates (mandalas, symbols, fluid line art, simple shapes).
	•	Trace over the design on a canvas (desktop + mobile).
	•	Colour and decorate the template with different brush sizes and colours.
	•	Optionally draw freehand (no template).
	•	Save/download their creation and optionally store it in their profile (if logged in / member).

This should feel simple, intuitive, and soothing, not like a complex design tool.

2. User Stories
	1.	As a guest user, I can open Art Meditation and try at least one free doodle template and a blank canvas without logging in.
	2.	As a logged-in user, I can choose from multiple templates, draw/colour, and download my artwork.
	3.	As a member (if membership exists), I can unlock extra premium templates and optionally save my doodles to “My Art” in my profile.
	4.	As any user, I can undo mistakes, clear the canvas, and choose simple brushes and colours without needing instructions.

4.1 Template System
	•	Templates are static line art images (PNG/SVG) initially (mandalas, symbols, simple shapes).
	•	App should:
	•	Load the chosen template and display it faintly on the canvas (e.g. low opacity).
	•	Allow user strokes on top without altering the template image.
	•	Template data structure (example):
