Recommendations
	1.	Modular or collapsible sidebar: Split the long panel into collapsible sections (e.g., “Music,” “Modes,” “Brushes,” “Utilities”). This keeps the music control visible while sketching and improves usability on mobile devices. You can use accordions or tabs so only one section is expanded at a time.
	2.	Premium music cues: Add subtle indicators (e.g., a gold badge or padlock icon) next to exclusive high‑vibration tracks so free users know what’s available in the paid membership. Provide a short sample of premium tracks and prompt users to upgrade for full access.
	3.	Membership upsell within the tool: For example, limit some brushes (like Watercolour or Alcohol Ink) or advanced symmetry modes to paid tiers and display a tooltip suggesting, “Unlock more brush styles with Essential membership.” This creates a clear benefit and encourages upgrades without disrupting free creation.
	4.	Player feedback and controls: Show a play/pause toggle, track name and progress bar when music is playing. Consider auto‑playing a default track when users first open the studio to showcase the meditative vibe.
	5.	Onboarding tooltips: When a user hovers over “Mandala Symmetry” or “Trace Template,” display a brief description (e.g., “Mirrors your strokes in eight‑fold symmetry” or “Trace over faint guides to create mandalas”). This helps beginners.
	6.	Cross‑link to Education Centre: Include a small link or info icon near “Trace Template” that opens a pop‑up or anchors to a short explanation from the Education Centre, guiding users to learn more about mandala meanings and how drawing supports emotional release.
	7.	Responsive layout improvements: On smaller screens, consider hiding the menu bar and adding a hamburger menu to free up vertical space. Make the canvas area resizable so users can focus on either drawing or controls without feeling cramped.
	8.	User progress and save features: Offer a simple account‑bound gallery where members can save and view past doodles. Tie this to membership tiers: free users can save a limited number of pieces, while paid users get unlimited storage and downloadable high‑resolution files.
	9.	Accessibility and contrast: Ensure all text and button colours meet contrast ratios for readability. The current gold and cream palette is elegant, but darker text may help some users
